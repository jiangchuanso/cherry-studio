# FilePreview

`FilePreview` is the canonical read-only preview host for local files. Callers provide a file path and decide where the preview appears. The host validates the path target and selects the preview strategy. PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX and images use the portable [file-preview package](../../../../packages/file-preview/README.md); HTML, Markdown and text remain local plugins.

The built-in plugins currently support HTML, images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`, `.avif`, `.ico`, `.svg` — SVG renders via `<img>`, which never executes embedded scripts), PDF, Word (`.docx`), PowerPoint (`.pptx`), spreadsheets (`.xlsx`), Markdown (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`), and text/source files. Files outside the text extension whitelist still use the text plugin when content sniffing identifies them as text.

## Path Contract

- Accept local absolute `AbsoluteFilePath` values only. POSIX and Windows paths are supported.
- Do not pass relative paths, `file://` URLs, HTTP URLs, Base64 values, or in-memory data.
- `FilePreview` lexically normalizes the path before resolving a plugin. It does not resolve symlinks or call `realpath`.
- `FilePreview` starts the extension plugin module load alongside `getMetadata`, but metadata still decides whether the
  candidate can render. Directories and inaccessible paths never reach a file plugin component.
- When a path comes from IPC or another untyped string source, validate it with `normalizeFilePreviewPath`. Do not bypass runtime validation with a type assertion.

```ts
import { normalizeFilePreviewPath } from '@renderer/utils/filePreview'

const filePath = normalizeFilePreviewPath(physicalPath)
```

## Embedded Preview

Import `FilePreview` from the module root and place it in a parent with a defined available height. The component fills its parent, and the plugin content area handles scrolling.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@cherrystudio/ui'
import { FilePreview } from '@renderer/components/FilePreview'
import type { AbsoluteFilePath } from '@shared/types/file'
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

interface FileDetailsProps {
  fileName: string
  filePath: AbsoluteFilePath
  onBack: () => void
  refreshKey?: number
}

export function FileDetails({ fileName, filePath, onBack, refreshKey }: FileDetailsProps) {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  return (
    <section className="flex min-h-0 flex-1">
      <FilePreview
        filePath={filePath}
        refreshKey={refreshKey}
        header={
          <>
            <Button onClick={onBack}>{t('common.back')}</Button>
            <span className="truncate">{fileName}</span>
          </>
        }
      />
    </section>
  )
}
```

The embedded host owns page-level interactions such as back, close, and file selection. Pass those controls as
`header` content when they should share the fixed top row with the plugin toolbar. `FilePreview` keeps caller content
on the left and portals the active plugin toolbar to the right. Do not pass format controls through `header` or add
`embedded`, `showBackButton`, or page-specific callbacks to `FilePreview`.

When an embedded host owns in-app file navigation, wrap the preview in `FilePreviewNavigationProvider` and provide
the workspace root and its absolute-path opener. The Markdown plugin then resolves schemeless links relative to that
workspace root and returns the absolute target to the host. Absolute links and relative links that lexically escape
with `..` can resolve outside that root; this provider does not enforce workspace containment, so the host owns any
access policy. Without this capability, previews retain Streamdown's default safe link treatment.

Use `type="artifact"` for an explicit development-artifact surface whose host owns editing. Markdown and HTML then
stay in rendered preview mode and omit their preview/source switch, while HTML uses the interactive artifact sandbox
so generated applications can run scripts. This does not hide format-specific controls such as PDF zoom or image
transforms.

All other callers default to `type="file"`. That type treats local HTML as untrusted, renders it with the
script-less sandbox and strict CSP, and keeps the plugin-owned preview/source switch. Do not mark an arbitrary local
file as an artifact merely to enable scripts.

## Tab Preview

Use `useOpenFilePreviewTab` below `TabsProvider`. The hook normalizes the path, creates a URL-encoded `/app/file-preview?path=...` target, and uses the cross-platform basename as the tab title.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@cherrystudio/ui'
import { useOpenFilePreviewTab } from '@renderer/components/FilePreview'
import type { AbsoluteFilePath } from '@shared/types/file'
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'

export function OpenPreviewButton({ filePath }: { filePath: AbsoluteFilePath }) {
  const { t } = useTranslation()
  const openFilePreviewTab = useOpenFilePreviewTab()

  return <Button onClick={() => openFilePreviewTab(filePath)}>{t('common.open_in_new_tab')}</Button>
}
```

The hook does not set `forceNew`. Equivalent normalized paths produce the same URL and reuse an existing tab. Reopening an existing tab increments its internal refresh key so the mounted plugin reloads the file. Pass the file's display name as the optional second argument when it differs from the physical path basename. The returned string is the tab ID when the caller needs it.

Embedded and tab previews are host composition choices, not `FilePreview` display variants. If users can switch between them, keep that choice in the calling page: set the current `filePath` for embedded mode or call `openFilePreviewTab(filePath)` for tab mode. Do not move this mode state into `FilePreview`.

## Plugin Structure

The public package has a static registry for its five formats. `ElectronFilePreview` supplies
`PreviewSource` through file IPC, forwards PDF resource reads and diagnostics, and builds
`SelectionReference` from its own path and metadata props. The desktop registry routes those formats through
that adapter. Only HTML, Markdown and text keep application-owned plugins under `plugins/`.
All formats reuse layout and toolbar components exported by the package.

For a desktop-only plugin, use this structure:

```text
plugins/example/
├── ExampleFilePreview.tsx
├── ExampleFilePreviewToolbar.tsx   # Create only when the plugin has controls
├── __tests__/
│   └── ExampleFilePreview.test.tsx
└── exampleFilePreviewPlugin.ts
```

The plugin descriptor declares only its identity, extensions, and lazy entry point:

```ts
import type { FilePreviewPlugin } from '../../types'

export const exampleFilePreviewPlugin = {
  id: 'example',
  extensions: ['example', 'example2'],
  load: () => import('./ExampleFilePreview')
} satisfies FilePreviewPlugin
```

Descriptor rules:

- `id` must be stable and unique within the registry.
- `extensions` must be lowercase and omit the leading dot. Use `pdf`, not `.pdf` or `PDF`.
- One extension can belong to only one plugin. Duplicate extensions throw when the registry is created.
- `load` must resolve to a module with a default React component export. Keep large rendering libraries inside the lazy module rather than the descriptor.
- The registry is static configuration. There is no runtime registration, priority, or caller override API.

The plugin component receives the normalized path, extracted filename, preflighted file metadata, a required refresh key, and an optional callback for reporting the user's selection (see [Selection references](#selection-references)):

```ts
interface FilePreviewPluginProps {
  filePath: AbsoluteFilePath
  fileName: string
  metadata: FilePreviewFileMetadata
  refreshKey: number
  type?: 'artifact' | 'file'
  onSelectionReference?: (reference: SelectionReference | null) => void
}
```

A plugin that honours `onSelectionReference` also sets `supportsSelectionReference: true` on its
descriptor. Hosts use `canProduceSelectionReference(filePath)` (exported from this module) to decide
whether to offer selection capture for a file at all.

The preview component must use a default export, read the file, and compose the module's internal layout:

```tsx
import { FilePreviewLayout } from '@cherrystudio/file-preview/react'
import type { FilePreviewPluginProps } from '../../types'
import { ExampleFilePreviewToolbar } from './ExampleFilePreviewToolbar'

export default function ExampleFilePreview({ filePath, fileName, metadata, refreshKey }: FilePreviewPluginProps) {
  // Load in an effect that depends on filePath and refreshKey. The plugin owns
  // file loading, view state, and toolbar actions here.

  return (
    <FilePreviewLayout.Frame>
      <ExampleFilePreviewToolbar disabled={false} />
      <FilePreviewLayout.Content>
        <div>{fileName} ({metadata.size} bytes)</div>
      </FilePreviewLayout.Content>
    </FilePreviewLayout.Frame>
  )
}
```

After implementing a desktop-only plugin, explicitly add it to `extensionPlugins`:

```ts
export const filePreviewRegistry = createFilePreviewRegistry({
  extensionPlugins: [exampleFilePreviewPlugin]
})
```

## Composition Rules

Keep the public `FilePreview` props minimal: `filePath`, optional `header`, optional `refreshKey`, optional `type`, and
optional `onSelectionReference`. Follow these boundaries when adding formats or capabilities:

- Express format differences as independent plugins. Do not add booleans such as `isPdf` or `isImage` to `FilePreview`.
- The plugin owns its loading state, view state, and actions. Its toolbar receives only the state and callbacks required for rendering.
- Put every plugin toolbar in a separate `<Format>FilePreviewToolbar.tsx` component. When a plugin has no controls, omit the toolbar completely instead of rendering an empty row.
- Compose toolbar content with `FilePreviewToolbar`. Use `FilePreviewToolbarButton` for icon commands and an appropriate UI primitive such as `SegmentedControl` for mode selection.
- Keep the renderer and file-loading lifecycle inside the plugin directory. Do not wrap an existing page or legacy preview panel; migrate that caller to `FilePreview` later instead of coupling the new plugin back to it.
- Represent mutually exclusive plugin views with an explicit union such as `'preview' | 'source'`, not several interacting booleans.
- Keep plugin capabilities inside the plugin. Do not expose a toolbar slot to callers or make calling pages manage format-specific state.
- `type="file"` is the default for arbitrary paths and must keep untrusted HTML script-less.
- Use `type="artifact"` only for a development-artifact surface that intentionally runs generated HTML and owns the
  source/edit experience. Plugins without an artifact-specific policy ignore it; their format controls remain visible.
- Treat `header` as host-owned navigation and identity content only. When it is absent, the plugin toolbar remains
  centered in its own row for Tab and standalone previews.

This composition lets the same plugin work in embedded and tab hosts without format-specific branches.

## Selection References

`onSelectionReference` is an optional pass-through channel for reporting the user's selection as a
`SelectionReference` (`@renderer/types/selectionReference`) — an anchor into the document's own structural
coordinates (worksheet range, paragraph ordinal, page number), never DOM or pixel coordinates.

- A plugin that owns a view → structure inverse mapping declares `supportsSelectionReference` and, while
  the callback is present, lets the user pick one addressable unit (docx body paragraph, pptx slide, pdf page,
  xlsx cell range) and reports it; it reports `null` when the pick is cleared, and the pdf producer
  reports `null` again the moment a new page pick starts, before that page's text has arrived. The callback's
  presence is the capture switch: the embedding surface passes it only while its picker is on, so a plugin never needs a
  separate mode flag. Plugins without such a mapping ignore the prop entirely.
- The xlsx grid follows the same picker model as the block producers: while the callback is present it starts
  from an empty selection, highlights the cell or merged range under the pointer, and commits on click or drag.
  It also picks from the keyboard — an arrow moves the cursor and commits the new cell, Shift+Arrow extends
  the range and commits it on key release, and Enter or Space commits the cursor cell — which the block
  producers do not: their pickers are pointer-only.
- Unlike the block producers, the xlsx grid holds a selection whether or not capture is on — a cell clicked
  to read a value stays selected. Capture therefore arms empty: the commit that switches capture on reports
  nothing, so a browsing selection never becomes a pick the user did not make, and every selection after it
  reports as usual, including re-picking the same range. Arming resets only when capture is switched off.
  The shared `Preview` stabilizes callbacks internally, so inline host callbacks do not repeat selection
  notifications on rerender; callback presence still controls capture.
- The desktop adapter converts the package's structural selection into a `SelectionReference` using the
  file path and metadata. What to do with a reference (show an action, inject it into a conversation) is the
  embedding surface's concern; neither the host nor the plugin renders reference UI.
- The host never synthesizes a `null` — a plugin unmount (file switch, refresh) emits nothing, so the embedding
  surface owns the held reference's lifetime across file changes. Each reference is self-describing (`path` +
  `fileStamp`), which keeps holding one safe.
- The embedding surface, not the host, reports `null` when it turns capture off (it stops passing the
  callback, so the plugin cannot). Text selection is never the capture gesture: most previews render
  inside the app-wide `user-select: none` (the PDF viewer is the exception — it opts back in with
  `.selectable` so its text layer stays copyable), and a block pick does not depend on it either way.
- Known limitation: a click on an in-document jump link picks nothing. The PDF and PPTX renderers both
  navigate from their own listener before the pick handler runs — pdf.js binds an internal destination
  with `link.onclick`, and the PPTX renderer's in-deck links are `role="link"` spans that stop
  propagation — so those links jump instead. External hyperlinks are intercepted and pick normally.
  A press on a floating chart or image in the xlsx grid picks nothing either: the cell beneath it is reachable
  only from the keyboard.
- The docx excerpt is not the paragraph's `textContent`: it is walked so that docx-preview's `<br>` and
  `<wbr>` become the `\n` and `-` python-docx's `Paragraph.text` spells, because the office-transform
  skill checks the excerpt against that string. Two gaps remain — docx-preview drops `w:cr` and `w:ptab`
  while python emits `\n` and `\t`, so a paragraph containing either can still fail that check; and page
  and column breaks are never rendered inline (a page break splits the paragraph into a new section),
  which the skill's patch-copy script refuses to rewrite anyway.
- Producers must fill `excerpt` (plain-text snapshot) and `fileStamp` (size + mtime at capture). A reference
  travels into the conversation as message text, so the only thing that acts on it is the `office-transform`
  skill, and the staleness rule lives in that skill's prompt: it tells the model to `stat` the file, compare
  size and mtime against `fileStamp`, and ask the user to re-select on a mismatch rather than re-anchoring.
  No code on either side performs that check, so the renderer's job is only to stamp references accurately —
  if an in-app consumer ever needs the comparison, it belongs with that consumer.

## File I/O, States, and Errors

- Opening surfaces should classify a clicked path before choosing UI: open directories in the file browser without a preview selection; send concrete files to `FilePreview`; let missing or inaccessible file selections reach `FilePreview` so it can show the unavailable state.
- `FilePreview` uses this routing model:

| Target | Preview decision | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Directory | No file plugin | File-browser surface; defensive folder state if passed directly |
| Existing file with a registered binary plugin | Registered plugin | Inline preview |
| Artifact HTML | HTML plugin with artifact policy | Interactive inline preview; host owns source/edit |
| Existing text file with a registered text plugin | Registered plugin after content sniff | Inline preview |
| Existing text file with no registered extension | Text fallback plugin | Source preview |
| Existing binary file with no registered plugin | Unsupported | Explanation plus safe default-app action |
| Missing or inaccessible path | Unavailable | Explanation without an open action |
| Invalid or non-absolute path | Invalid | Explanation without an open action |

- Local text plugins use `window.api.fs.readText`. Shared plugins read through `PreviewDocument`;
  they never access Electron APIs. The adapter serves whole-document reads with one full
  `file.read` and PDF ranges with 1 MiB range requests, checking every response against the
  metadata version. Size/mtime consistency checks apply to DOCX, PPTX, XLSX and images as
  well as PDF. A file changed after metadata was read fails the session; refresh to read new metadata.
- Shared full reads enforce source budgets: DOCX/PPTX 25 MiB, XLSX 20 MiB, images 64 MiB.
  PDF keeps a 16 MiB assembled-range cap, not a whole-file size cap, and delegates its external
  fallback to the host.
- The public preview closes sessions on replacement, refresh, failure and unmount, including late
  opens. Abort signals discard the result of an in-flight IPC read; they do not stop that request
  or its byte copy. PDF range reads also check cancellation between 1 MiB requests.
  Synchronous parsing cannot be interrupted.
- Local loading effects depend on `filePath` and `refreshKey`. Shared plugins reload when their
  opened document changes. Do not request metadata again inside a format plugin.
- `FilePreview` owns directory, invalid-path, unavailable-path, unsupported-format, plugin-load, and synchronous render error states.
- A plugin owns its loading, empty, too-large, and read-error states. It must catch asynchronous failures from effects and event handlers so errors remain inside the preview region.
- The desktop adapter routes package `onDiagnostic` events to `loggerService`, preserving `Error`
  values for error reporting. Terminal failures emit one diagnostic; `onError` is a state notification,
  not a second logging channel. Expected size limits are warnings. Keep raw diagnostics out of UI copy.
- Images load as whole-document bytes through IPC and a Blob URL, with a 64 MiB limit; they no
  longer load directly from a file URL. Oversized images have the same explicit external-open action
  as Office documents. Unsupported formats also open externally only after a user click.
- Cancel, disconnect, or destroy file reads, workers, listeners, and third-party instances when the component unmounts, `filePath` changes, or `refreshKey` changes.

## UI and Copy

- Build new UI with `@cherrystudio/ui` and Tailwind CSS, following the repository [DESIGN.md](../../../../DESIGN.md).
- Use Lucide icons in toolbars. Icon buttons require an accessible name and a tooltip.
- Put plugin-specific copy under `file_preview.*` i18n keys, reuse existing `common.*` or `preview.*` keys for shared controls, and update `en-us` and `zh-cn`.
- Keep the toolbar at a stable height. Only `FilePreviewLayout.Content` should own content scrolling.

## Verification

A new plugin should have focused coverage for at least these cases:

- Its extensions resolve to the correct plugin without conflicting with existing extensions.
- The lazy component receives the normalized `filePath`, correct `fileName`, preflighted `metadata`, and current `refreshKey`.
- Loading, success, empty, and read-error states remain contained within the preview region.
- Toolbar actions, disabled states, and cleanup behavior work as expected.

Run the focused plugin and registry Vitest suites first, followed by the repository-required formatting and static checks.

/**
 * Knowledge-base tools (kb_search / kb_read / kb_list / kb_manage) hosted by the
 * in-process `cherry-tools` MCP server (see `cherryBuiltinTools.ts`).
 *
 * This provider owns the whole knowledge-base domain on the agent path: it registers the
 * kb_* tools only when the agent's *effective* knowledge scope is non-empty when the
 * connection opens (unless the built-in Assistant has unrestricted access), re-derives that
 * scope on every call, rejects an unscoped call (fail-closed), and scopes every
 * `knowledgeLookup` core call to it. The effective scope is
 * `resolveKnowledgeBaseScope(binding, composerSelection)`, so an agent with no static
 * binding still gets the tools when the composer picked bases for the turn. Only the
 * binding half is live — the composer selection is frozen when the server set is built, so
 * changing it takes a rebuild. The destructive `kb_manage` tool relies on Claude Code's own
 * per-call permission prompt for approval (the AI-SDK path uses `needsApproval` instead).
 *
 * Scope is modelled as an explicit {@link KnowledgeScope} rather than a bare id array so
 * the "empty scope" case can never be silently reinterpreted as "all bases": the shared
 * `knowledgeLookup` core treats an empty `allowedIds` as unrestricted, so only the explicit
 * `unrestricted` variant may pass an empty list down.
